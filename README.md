# gen-ai-bootcamp-2025
This repository is designed as part of the Gen AI Bootcamp by FreeCodeCamp.

The goal of this project is to apply AI-driven solutions to augment the learning experience for students at a Japanese Language Learning School. This AI system will help extend the language offerings and provide valuable resources for students to practice and improve their language skills outside of instructor-led classes.

Key Features:
Extend Language Offerings: Using AI to integrate additional languages, such as Haitian Creole and another Asian language, to diversify and enhance the language curriculum.
Interactive Learning Tools: Develop AI-powered tools to support language learning, such as speech recognition, grammar correction, and personalized learning recommendations.
Augmented Learning Experience: Enable students to continue their learning journey even between live classes with AI-driven chatbots, quizzes, and practice exercises tailored to their proficiency level.
Project Aims:
Empower students to learn languages effectively and autonomously.
Improve student engagement through AI-based tools.
Expand language options to support multilingual learning and cultural diversity.
