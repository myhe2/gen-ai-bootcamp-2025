# Business Case #

The goal of this case is to implement AI-driven solutions to enhance the learning experience for students at X Language Learning School, which specializes in Korean and Haitian Creole. The company aims to create an in-house platform that not only ensures MNIP security but also remains cost-effective. By incorporating AI, the school intends to optimize its educational processes, improve content delivery, and provide personalized learning experiences that adapt to the individual progress of students. The platform will be available through a website and mobile app, offering flexibility and accessibility while maintaining robust security measures to protect student data.

Key Features and Benefits:

The teaching model at X Language Learning School pairs each teacher with a group of five students, ensuring a mix of proficiency levels to encourage peer assistance and collaborative learning. Students are assigned designated virtual class times, but can be located anywhere, allowing for greater flexibility in scheduling. The curriculum, designed by teachers using an established framework, will continue to evolve with the integration of AI to improve and personalize learning content. This continuous improvement will be cost-effective, helping the small business scale and adapt while maintaining high-quality education.


## Assumptions ##

The data strategy is the integration of teachers' previous years worth of curriculum will serve as valuable input to guide and refine the AI, ensuring the learning experience remains relevant and tailored to studentsâ€™ needs. That will be backed by an open-source  model that is cost-effective to X's budget. Additionally, the platform will be designed with scalability in mind, allowing the system to accommodate growing numbers of students, teachers, and additional languages or content areas in the future.

Both teachers and students are average in tech-savviness.


## Complexity ##

Some complexities to be aware of:
- The open-source model requires constant monitoring to ensure accuracy, effectiveness, security, and adaptation to student needs. 
- Budgeting for maintenance and ongoing improvements will be critical for the long-term success of the platform. Either consider a thrid party or hire a person. 
- Since the model will be using teachers' previous years worth of curriculum to also learn there might be Curriculum Flexibility issues. We need to ensure that the AI complements rather than constrains the flexibility of the curriculum from X rather than over-rride the curriculum to favor the open-source data (a Key lever of cost).


## Risk ##

Since the platform will handle sensitive student information, there is a risk of data breaches or non-compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., MNIP standards).
