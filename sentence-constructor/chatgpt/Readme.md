3.Split complext task into smaller simpler task 
4. Give model time to think 
5. Use external tools. Like a Rag to give relevant information

## Model ##
I’m using GPT-4 Turbo, which is a variant of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a large language model developed by OpenAI based on the transformer architecture. It’s designed to be faster and more efficient, while still delivering great responses!

## Challenges:#

This model tends to have many errors of not following the prompt compare to meta. It seems that it's learning abilities last for a moment before reverting. An example of the interaction still does not help.

## Restrictions ##
Free version of chat gpt.
